# Financial Calculator Project Plan

## Project Overview
Create a React-based financial calculator web application that helps users analyze their housing affordability based on income, expenses, and loan parameters. The app will be built using Next.js, TypeScript, Shadcn UI, and modern React practices.

## Project Goals
1. Provide accurate loan calculations based on Swedish banking practices
2. Enable detailed expense tracking across 13 major categories
3. Visualize financial data for better decision making
4. Support both Swedish and English languages
5. Deliver a responsive, user-friendly interface
